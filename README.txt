This is an payroll accounting program build in accordance with Bulgarian social security laws.
If you want to add new data use the forms danni_forma_76.html, danni_osiguren.html or danni_osiguritel.html.
After each new entry click "Save", when ready - click download.
If you want to start over click "Clear".

If you execute the file read_arr.py this will generate a file EMPL2000.txt, based on the
data in danni_forma_76.csv, danni_osiguren.csv and danni_osiguritel.csv.

Currently only 17 of the total of 50 fields in EMPL2000.txt are filled with the required
information.

The python script has appropriate comments, while for now the HTML script is uncommented.
Please share your thoughts if you have ideas for improvisation and clarification of the program.
