If you execute the file read_arr.py this will generate a file EMPL2000.txt, based on the
data in danni_forma_76.csv, danni_osiguren.csv and danni_osiguritel.csv.

Currently only 17 of the total of 50 fields in EMPL2000.txt are filled with the required
information. 

If you have any questions related to the input forms or Form 1 according to Ordinance "N8" please visit:

Please share your thoughts on possible improvements of the program.
